                ...'haps was with great trepidition, that one could appreciate when about to lose something. Something of great value that he knew could not be found elsewhere. Imagine for a moment, a prospector. He has searched all his life for treasure, something that would set him up for life <br>
                retire to some beach somewhere, somewhere serene basking in all of natures beauty. Then one day he hits the mother lode, a rich gold vein. He drops to his knees in silence and awe. He can not believe his luck. All his friends were doing well, having discovered theirs and now finally <br>
                it was his time. He leaps up in excitement as tears streamed down his face. There was no one to witness him in his moment of elation, his voice echoing into the surrounding hills. The gold, as though showing its pleasure at being discovered, gleamed in the sunlight. He heads home <br>
                to begin preparations for laying his claim and everyday he would head back to the vein, trying to know more. How far does it extend, what other secrets does it hold? And with each new discovery, he understands it more. It's branches, the boundaries, how rooted it is in the rock, <br>
                the parts of itself that had been eroded and washed away downstream by nature. The gold itself, understanding the prospector, his limits and when he's exhausted. <br>
                Then one day, the prospector heads out to go finalize what he had been working on. Getting there he finds other prospectors, the gold being carted away. He tries to protest, to fight, but its seemingly too late. Everyday he goes back there and watches as what he thought was his being <br>
                carted away. His friends try to tell him not to. Let go and look for another, but how can he. After so long of searching, after all that had transpired. And so he keeps going back, until one day he goes there, only to realize everyone has left, the gold completely gone. He sinks to his knees, <br>
                as tears stream down his face and then leaps up and howls. His voice echoing in the hills, no witness in his moment of despair.

                A paragraph of placeholder text. We're using it here to show the use of the clearfix class. We're adding quite a few meaningless phrases here to demonstrate how the columns interact here with the floated image.
              </p>
            
              <p class="">
                As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now imagine how this would look with some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should not really be read.
              </p>
            
              <p class="">
                And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text, hoping for some more insights, or some hidden easter egg of content. A joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that here.
